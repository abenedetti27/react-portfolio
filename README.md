## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
When the users loads the portfolio, they are presented with a page containing a header, section for content, and a footer. When the user views the hearer, they are presented with my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

The navigation titles the user is presented with are About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. When the user clicks on a navigation title, they are presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

When the portfolio is loaded the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default. The About Me section contains a recent photo and a short bio. Th Portfolio section contains titles and images of six applications with links to the deployed application and the corresponding GitHub repository.
